# Sudoku solver (Worker Threads)

## Use your sudoku

Go to a file `./src/data/sudokuData.txt` and encode your sudoku in a similar way (row by row). Use dash `-` to mark unsolved cells

## Usage: simple algorithm

Build the project with `npm run build`, then start with `npm start n` to solve the `n`-th sudoku in the data file.

## Usage: algorithm with worker threads

Build the project with `npm run build:threads`, then start with `npm run start:threads n` to solve the `n`-th sudoku in the data file.
